# Liminal Experience

This project is about the AWE experience.
Optimised for working on oculus go

Setup:

if you do not have Git installed, Download Git https://git-scm.com/downloads
Once git has been installed, open Comand Prompt and type git, it should recognize git.
Confirm it by going opening command prompt (windows key > cmd ) then type git. It should give you a start with usage: git

In the case that it does not work, you will have to do the following.

Otherwise, locate yourpath/cmd/git.exe, copy the path to just yurpath/cmd/
Add the path to cmd to your Environment Variables. (Press Window, Search Environment Variables)

!!! Important !!!

If this is your first time adding a git path to your environment variable, you must ensure all Unity instances are closed after setting up git.
Alternatively, you can just restart your machine.


After setting up the project in play mode you will see 3 Chakras which upon clicking will simulate environment changes.

some environment changes might be subtle.

Enjoy....
